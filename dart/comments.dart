// Comments
// Dart supports single-line comments, multi-line comments, and documentation comments.

//  Single-line comments

/*
 Multi-line comments can nest.
*/

/// Documentation comments. 
/// Inside a documentation comment, the analyzer ignores all text unless it is enclosed in brackets. 
/// [ ] Using brackets, you can refer to classes, methods, fields, top-level variables, functions, and parameters.

// This is a normal, one-line comment.

/// This is a documentation comment, used to document libraries,
/// classes, and their members. Tools like IDEs and dartdoc treat
/// doc comments specially.

/* Comments like these are also supported. */
