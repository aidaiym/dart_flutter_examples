/* getters and setters --- more control.
 Getter and setter methods are the class methods used to manipulate the data of the class fields. 
 Getter is used to read or get the data of the class field whereas setter is used to set the data of the class field to some variable.

Getter
It is used to retrieve a particular class field and save it in a variable. 
All classes have a default getter method but it can be overridden explicitly. 
The getter method can be defined using the get keyword as:

return_type get field_name{
    ...
}
It must be noted we have to define a return type but there is no need to define parameters in the above method.

Setter

It is used to set the data inside a variable received from the getter method. 
All classes have a default setter method but it can be overridden explicitly. 
The setter method can be defined using the set keyword as:

set field_name{
    ...
}
