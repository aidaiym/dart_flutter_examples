DO use collection literals when possible.
Linter rule: prefer_collection_literals

Dart has three core collection types: List, Map, and Set. The Map and Set classes have unnamed constructors like most classes do. But because these collections are used so frequently, Dart has nicer built-in syntax for creating them:

var points = <Point>[];
var addresses = <String, Address>{};
var counts = <int>{};

DO use a function declaration to bind a function to a name.
Linter rule: prefer_function_declarations_over_variables

Modern languages have realized how useful local nested functions and closures are. It’s common to have a function defined inside another one. In many cases, this function is used as a callback immediately and doesn’t need a name. A function expression is great for that.

But, if you do need to give it a name, use a function declaration statement instead of binding a lambda to a variable.

void main() {
  void localFunction() {
    ...
  }
}

DON’T create a lambda when a tear-off will do.
