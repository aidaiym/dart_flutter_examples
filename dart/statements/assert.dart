// Assert
// During development, use an assert statement—assert(condition, optionalMessage);—to disrupt normal execution if a boolean condition is false. You can find examples of assert statements throughout this tour. Here are some more:

// // Make sure the variable has a non-null value.
// assert(text != null);

// // Make sure the value is less than 100.
// assert(number < 100);

// // Make sure this is an https URL.
// assert(urlString.startsWith('https'));
