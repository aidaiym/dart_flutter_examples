/*
Iterables are basic building blocks for all sorts of Dart applications, and you’re probably already using them, even without noticing.
A collection is an object that represents a group of objects, which are called elements.
Iterables are a kind of collection.
A collection can be empty, or it can contain many elements.
Depending on the purpose, collections can have different structures and implementations. These are some of the most common collection types:

List: Used to read elements by their indexes.
Set: Used to contain elements that can occur only once.
Map: Used to read elements using a key.

read elements with elementAt()

// firstWhere()
// You can also find the first element that satisfies a condition with firstWhere().
// You can write test predicates as expressions, blocks, or functions.

// Predicate: A function that returns true when a certain condition is satisfied.

// String element = iterable.firstWhere((element) => element.length > 5);

// any(): Returns true if at least one element satisfies the condition.
// every(): Returns true if all elements satisfy the condition.

// Although you can use for-in loops to check conditions, there are better ways to do that.
// The method any() enables you to check whether any element satisfies a condition.
// The method every() enables you to verify that all elements satisfy a condition.

// Filter the elements of an Iterable with where().
// The output of where() is another Iterable.
// Use takeWhile() and skipWhile() to obtain elements until or after a condition is met.
// The output of these methods can be an empty Iterable.

// map() applies a function to all the elements of an Iterable.
// The output of map() is another Iterable.
// The function isn’t evaluated until the Iterable is iterated.
