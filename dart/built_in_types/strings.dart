// Another way to create a multi-line string: use a triple quote with either single or double quotation marks:
String s1 = '''
You can create
multi-line strings like this one.
''';

String s2 = """This is also a
multi-line string.""";

// You can create a “raw” string by prefixing it with r:

var s = r'In a raw string, not even \n gets special treatment.';
